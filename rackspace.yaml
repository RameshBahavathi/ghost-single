  #### Accessing Your Deployment

  If you provided a domain name that is associated with your Rackspace Cloud
  account and chose to create DNS records, you should be able to navigate to
  the provided domain name in your browser. If DNS has not been configured yet,
  please refer to this
  [documentation](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/how-do-i-modify-my-hosts-file)
  on how to setup your Hosts file to allow your browser to access your
  Deployment via domain name.

  To SSH into your server as "root", please use the SSH private key provided in
  the deployment's secrets. Please refer to our Knowledge Center for
  instructions on how to use SSH keys on
  [Linux/Mac](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  or
  [Windows](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).

  You may also SSH into the server as the "ghost" user with the "ghost User
  Password" provided in the deployment's secrets. Once logged in as this user,
  you can use "sudo" to perform commands as root. The following commands will
  assume you are using the "ghost" user and will use "sudo". If you prefer to
  use "root", please drop the "sudo" from the examples.

  Once you have SSH'd into your server, you will find Ghost installed in
  /var/www/vhosts/<domain_name>. There is an
  [Upstart](http://upstart.ubuntu.com/) job configured in
  "/etc/init/ghost.conf" to control the Ghost service. You can start or stop
  the Ghost service by running "sudo start ghost" or "sudo stop ghost". You can
  find logs for the Ghost service in "/var/log/upstart/ghost.log". Ghost runs
  on port 2368; however, Nginx is configured to listen on port 80 and 443 (if
  SSL was configured) and pass requests to 2368. You can find the Nginx
  configuration for Ghost in "/etc/nginx/sites-available/ghost.conf".

  #### Getting Started

  Ghost is a new blogging platform dedicated to providing a simple, easy to use
  approach to blogging. Ghost allows you to write and publish your own blog,
  giving you the tools to make it easy and even fun to do. It's simple,
  elegant, and designed so that you can spend less time messing with making
  your blog work - and more time blogging.

  The first step with your new blog is to navigate to `/ghost/signup` where you
  will create the your user. Ghost currently only supports one user at this
  time. After filling out this info, you will be redirected to the admin panel
  where you can start customizing your blog and adding new posts. To access the
  admin panel again, navigate to `/ghost`.

  For more information on using Ghost please check out Ghost's [usage
  forums](https://ghost.org/forum/using-ghost/).

  #### Plugins

  Ghost is new and is still in heavy development. However, there are already
  some plugins and themes to help customize your experience. Checkout the Ghost
  [Marketplace](http://marketplace.ghost.org/) for links. Users coming from
  WordPress may also be interested in this [WordPress
  plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ghost/) to help migrate data from
  WordPress to Ghost.
